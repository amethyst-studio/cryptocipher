## What is CryptoCipher?

Our project is a Node.js module designed to add ease of access to many encryption and hashing methods supplied by Node.js, while handling the security behind the scenes. Enforcing a standard set of secret key lengths and higher internal defaults will ensure that CryptoCipher will always provide the highest security possible to you, even if you are inexperienced with encryption yourself as a whole.

## Installation

You can find the installation guide, along with much more information, on our wiki!
